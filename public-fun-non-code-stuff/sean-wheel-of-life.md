# Sean's Wheel of Life

> **DRAFT:** Claude wrote this at Sean's request, based on inferences from project files and work journals. Sean hasn't validated the identity premises here; treat as a starting point to revise.

A personalized version of the "Wheel of Life" coaching tool, adapted from the Co-Active Institute framework. These eight domains represent the areas I want to intentionally cultivate.

---

## Travel

Experiencing new places; not just as a tourist, but as someone who engages with where they are. This includes planning trips that create meaningful experiences, returning to places that feel like a second home (like Park City), and having the calendar infrastructure to actually get where I need to be without friction. Travel is both the destination and the logistics of getting there smoothly.

---

## Health / Fitness

The foundation everything else depends on. This means understanding what actually works (collagen research, not bro-science), cooking real food from recipes I've collected, and maintaining the physical capacity to do the things I want to do. Health isn't a goal in itself; it's the substrate that makes everything else possible.

---

## Community

The people I learn with, build with, and contribute to. This includes the technical community (shipping to GitHub, writing LinkedIn posts that help others learn), people from coaching training, and the broader circle of people who make life richer. Community isn't just receiving; it's the curriculum I might one day offer others, paying forward what I've learned.

---

## Family

The inner circle. The people I travel with, share meals with, and make a home with. Family is the "why" behind many of the logistics I build; the calendar automaton exists partly so I show up on time to dinner, not just meetings. This domain is less about optimization and more about presence.

---

## Living Situation

Where and how I live, day-to-day. This includes the physical environment (home base, temporary locations like Park City), the systems that make it run smoothly, and the feeling of having a place that supports rather than drains energy. Living situation is the container for everything else.

---

## Publishing

Making work visible. This is the "ship it" muscle: GitHub repos with clean READMEs, LinkedIn posts that share what I've learned, Chrome extensions on the Web Store, maybe eventually blog posts or talks. Publishing isn't vanity; it's the forcing function that turns private tinkering into completed work others can use or learn from. The public visibility ladder: ship to yourself, then to GitHub, then to LinkedIn, then to the world.

---

## Money

Financial health and the freedom it enables. This includes understanding my investments (hence the email parsing project), making informed decisions, and having enough runway to choose projects based on interest rather than necessity. Money is a tool, not a scorecard; but it's a tool worth understanding well.

---

## Ambition

The drive to build, learn, and grow. This is the "complete before expanding" philosophy in action: not chasing every shiny thing, but picking meaningful projects and seeing them through. Ambition means having a roadmap (AI agent development, shipping products), measuring progress against real milestones, and continuously raising the bar for what "done" looks like.
