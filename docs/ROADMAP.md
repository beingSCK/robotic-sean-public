# AI Agent Development: Learning Roadmap

A completion-focused progression anchored to real projects, building towards public visibility.

---

## Philosophy: Complete Before Expanding

The temptation with technical learning is to start many projects and finish none. Each "Phase 1" feels like progress, but a graveyard of 40%-complete projects teaches less than one shipped tool you actually use.

**Core principle:** Every project should have a clear "Definition of Done" and a public output milestone.

**The progression:**
1. **Ship to yourself** — A tool that works on your machine
2. **Ship to GitHub** — Code others could run
3. **Ship to LinkedIn** — A post explaining what you built and learned
4. **Ship to blog** — A deeper writeup with context and lessons

You don't need to hit all four for every project. But having the ladder in mind prevents the "perpetual private tinkering" trap.

## Learning Curriculum

This isn't a linear "finish one project, start another" roadmap. It's a curriculum that **interleaves projects** to build skills progressively and avoid burnout.

| Phase | Focus | Key Skills | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| **LP1** | Calendar Tool MVP | API integration, OAuth, shipping to GitHub | ✅ Complete |
| **LP2** | Investment DB: Email Pipeline | Data extraction, SQLite, text processing | 🎯 Up Next |
| **LP3** | Chatbot: Agent Patterns | Agentic loops, tool use, prompt engineering | Planned |
| **LP4** | Calendar Tool: Chrome Extension | TypeScript or cloud deployment, browser extensions | Planned |
| **LP5** | Investment DB: RAG Pipeline | Embeddings, vector search, retrieval | Planned |
| **LP6** | Chatbot: Polish & Ship | Memory, sessions, productionization | Planned |

**Current focus:** LP1 wrap-up (GitHub cleanup, LinkedIn post) → LP2 (Investment DB email pipeline)

## The Public Visibility Ladder

| Level | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| 0. Private | Works on your machine | Always first |
| 1. GitHub | Public repo, clean README | After "Definition of Done" |
| 2. LinkedIn | Short post (200-400 words) | After GitHub, for networking value |
| **2.5. Ship Product** | **Working product others can use** | **When project warrants it (optional)** |
| 3. Blog | Longer writeup (1000+ words) | For substantial projects |
| 4. Talk/Video | Conference talk, YouTube | When you have a compelling story |

> **Level 2.5 (Ship Product)** is optional but recommended when the project naturally becomes something others would use. Examples:
> - Calendar Transit Tool → Chrome extension on Web Store
> - Investment DB → Probably not (too personal/niche)
> - Chatbot Rebuild → Could become a template/starter kit
>
> Shipping a real product builds different muscles than shipping code. It requires thinking about UX, onboarding, and real users—valuable even if only 10 people use it.

**Near-term goal:** Hit Level 2 (GitHub + LinkedIn) for Calendar Tool. Consider Level 2.5 (Chrome extension) in LP4.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Complete before expanding** — A finished small tool beats three half-built systems
2. **Real data, real use cases** — Your calendar and investment emails are better than toy datasets
3. **Progressive publicity** — GitHub → LinkedIn → Blog builds the "shipping" muscle
4. **Understand before abstracting** — Write the loop yourself before reaching for LangChain
5. **Definition of Done** — Every phase needs a clear completion criteria

The goal isn't to learn "AI agents" in the abstract. It's to build tools you actually use, understand how they work, and develop the habit of shipping publicly.
