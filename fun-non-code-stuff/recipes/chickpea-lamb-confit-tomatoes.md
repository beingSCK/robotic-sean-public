# Chickpea & Lamb with Confit Tomatoes

A hearty dish featuring spiced lamb and chickpeas, slow-roasted confit tomatoes, and a punchy garlicky yogurt sauce.

## Serves

4 people generously, with extra yogurt sauce and confit tomatoes (+ flavored oil) to save for later. You can stretch to 6 by adding rice to the chickpea and lamb dish. For larger gatherings, double the recipe and cook the lamb + chickpea portion in batches.

## Shopping List

### Garlicky Yogurt Sauce
- Greek Yogurt (full fat tastes better!)
- Fresh Garlic (buy at least one full head, more is better)
- Lemon (fresh or pre-squeezed juice - either works)

### Confit Tomatoes
- Lots of olive oil (look for a big can)
- Organic vine-ripened tomatoes (~10, smaller tomatoes still on the vine preferred)
- Fresh Rosemary
- Fresh Thyme

### Lamb (or alt protein) + Chickpeas
- 1 lb ground lamb (plant-based ground works great too)
- ~32 oz canned chickpeas, ideally organic (one large or two small cans)
- Cumin Seed (not ground!)
- Fresh Garlic (way better than powder or pre-peeled)

### Vegetable Side
- Swiss Chard (or substitute bok choy or any greens you prefer)

## Garlicky Yogurt Sauce

1. Chop fresh garlic into the smallest pieces you can.

2. Add garlic to yogurt, and season with a little bit of salt, pepper, and lemon juice to start.

3. **Garlic:** Don't hold back - more than looks reasonable, then add 30% more. Half a head of garlic into a medium tub of yogurt works great.

4. **Lemon Juice:** Start with a couple teaspoons, then taste and adjust until it feels balanced.

5. **Salt:** Add some, mix, then adjust to your taste.

6. **Pepper:** Fresh ground is best. The pepper specks add a lot to the visual appeal of the dish.

## Confit Tomatoes

1. Set oven to 325 degrees.

2. Take out a large-ish glass casserole dish.

3. Rinse tomatoes and herbs.

4. Cut tomatoes into quarters.

5. Lay out fresh herbs on the bottom of the casserole dish. Be generous - the bottom should feel "covered-ish."

6. Lay out quartered tomatoes (skin side down) on the fresh herbs.

7. Pour oil over everything. You want to "wet" every exposed tomato surface. Don't need to fully submerge the tomatoes, but get close - aim for smaller quarters floating, larger tomatoes about 80% submerged (but still resting on the herbs below).

8. Season with salt and pepper (go light on salt).

9. Bake for **at least 2 hours**. The original recipe calls for 3.5 hours. Starting around 3 hours, check how crispy they're getting. At 4 hours they'll probably be "genuinely burnt," but some crispiness is good (Maillard reaction flavors!).

## Lamb + Chickpeas

*(Recipe details for the lamb + chickpea portion to be added - involves browning the meat with cumin seeds and garlic, then adding drained chickpeas)*

## Assembly

Serve the spiced lamb and chickpeas alongside (or over) the confit tomatoes, with generous dollops of the garlicky yogurt sauce. The flavored oil from the tomatoes is liquid gold - drizzle it over everything.
