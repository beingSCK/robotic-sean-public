# AI Agent Development: Learning Roadmap

A completion-focused progression anchored to real projects, building towards public visibility.

---

## Philosophy: Complete Before Expanding

The temptation with technical learning is to start many projects and finish none. Each "Phase 1" feels like progress, but a graveyard of 40%-complete projects teaches less than one shipped tool you actually use.

**Core principle:** Every project should have a clear "Definition of Done" and a public output milestone.

**The progression:**
1. **Ship to yourself** — A tool that works on your machine
2. **Ship to GitHub** — Code others could run
3. **Ship to LinkedIn** — A post explaining what you built and learned
4. **Ship to blog** — A deeper writeup with context and lessons

You don't need to hit all four for every project. But having the ladder in mind prevents the "perpetual private tinkering" trap.

## Current Project Status

| Project | Status | Next Step | Public Output |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Calendar Transit Tool | Execute mode working (stub times) | Real Routes API integration | GitHub repo, LinkedIn post |
| Investment DB | Schema created, emails waiting | Parse mbox, build pipeline | Blog post (after RAG working) |
| Chatbot Rebuild | Reference material ready | Build our own agent loop | Demo + learning writeup |

**Current focus:** Calendar Transit Tool (quick win to ship)

## The Public Visibility Ladder

| Level | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| 0. Private | Works on your machine | Always first |
| 1. GitHub | Public repo, clean README | After "Definition of Done" |
| 2. LinkedIn | Short post (200-400 words) | After GitHub, for networking value |
| 3. Blog | Longer writeup (1000+ words) | For substantial projects |
| 4. Talk/Video | Conference talk, YouTube | When you have a compelling story |

**Goal for next 2 months:** Hit Level 2 (GitHub + LinkedIn) for Calendar Tool, Level 3 (Blog) for Investment Tracker.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Complete before expanding** — A finished small tool beats three half-built systems
2. **Real data, real use cases** — Your calendar and investment emails are better than toy datasets
3. **Progressive publicity** — GitHub → LinkedIn → Blog builds the "shipping" muscle
4. **Understand before abstracting** — Write the loop yourself before reaching for LangChain
5. **Definition of Done** — Every phase needs a clear completion criteria

The goal isn't to learn "AI agents" in the abstract. It's to build tools you actually use, understand how they work, and develop the habit of shipping publicly.
